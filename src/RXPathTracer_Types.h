	RXPathTracer is an MPI-parallel program for simulating the growth stage during
	primary recrystallization. Its foundations are detailed in 
	
	  ''Efficient Recrystallization Microstructure Modeling by Utilizing Parallel Computation''
	  PhD thesis RWTH Aachen University
	  Successfully defended and accepted for publication August, 14th, 2017
	  Finally open source published in January, 2018
