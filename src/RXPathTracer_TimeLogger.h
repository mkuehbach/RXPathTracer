	RXPathTracer is an MPI-parallel program for simulating the growth stage during
	primary recrystallization. Its foundations are detailed in 
	
	  ''Efficient Recrystallization Microstructure Modeling by Utilizing Parallel Computation''
	  PhD thesis RWTH Aachen University
	  Successfully defended and accepted for publication August, 14th, 2017
	  Finally open source published in January, 2018
	  
	The source code was developed by Markus Kühbach (as part of his PhD) and Paul Hoffrogge 
	(as part of a bachelor thesis project) under supervision of Luis A. Barrales-Mora and 
	Günter Gottstein at the Institute of Physical Metallurgy and Metal Physics with RWTH Aachen University.
