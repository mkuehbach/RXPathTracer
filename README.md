# RXPathTracer
A Raytracing-based solitary unit model for primary recrystallization

This repository supplements my PhD thesis on "Efficient Recrystallization Microstructure Modeling by Utilizing Parallel Computation" with the original source code to the RXPathTracer model. It is detailed in chapter 6 - A Geometrical
Solitary Unit Model for Recrystallization.

The thesis, supervised by Prof. Dr.rer. nat. Dr. h. c. GÃ¼nter Gottstein and Prof. Dr.rer. nat. Robert Svendsen, was successfully defended with RWTH Aachen University on August, 14th, 2017. The final manuscript will be made open source available in January 2018.
